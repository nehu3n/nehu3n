# Hi! I'm Nehuén.

I'm a **passionate developer** who loves learning and exploring new technologies. I enjoy tackling challenges and creating **innovative solutions** that improve tools I find useful. I don't stick to a specific tech stack; instead, **I like to expand my knowledge** and step out of my comfort zone.

I've been coding since I was eleven, and I haven't stopped since! I'm driven to constantly refine my work, aiming to deliver the best version of every project with a **focus on scalability and performance—maybe** I'm a bit of a **perfectionist** when it comes to code.

I also **love animals** (especially **cats 🐱**), **music** from any genre, and of course, **optimizing performance** in everything I do, especially in software 😅.

###### Did I mention I love anything labeled _blazing fast_?
